    "# Introduction and Word Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two thoughts of Prof Christopher Manning  about language:\n",
    "    - Language is such an evolved system of communication, but very **uncertain**.\n",
    "        - However humans have some agreed meaning which helps us communicate so well.\n",
    "        - We are internally and subconsciously doing some kind of probabilistic inference to determine meaning not just for information but also for social functions etc.\n",
    "    - For artificial intelligence to reach at a very sophisticated level, it needs to be able to capture all of the human knowledge, which is predominantly conveyed through human language. \n",
    "        - Human language is our networking language through which we collectively form a huge network of individuals.\n",
    "        - Human language made human being invincible. Language made humans to be able to work collectively as a group or team.  That is how they evolved not to just survive in a world of more powerful animals but they thrived.\n",
    "        - Invention of writing made this knowledge to shared spatially (i.e. through space) or temporally (i.e. through time) not just verbally. \n",
    "        - Writing is very recent (~5000 years) phenomenon in scale of evolution, but made humans super powerful.\n",
    "        - We compress knowledge efficiently and provide a view of the world in very few bits of information (e.g. I went to Zoo and saw an elephant. When you read this it constructs the whole visual scenery in your mind with images which can take few megabytes to store in a computer, but was communicated in very little words).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do we represent the meaning of the words?\n",
    "- Linguists use something called Denotational Semantics to think about meaning.\n",
    "    - Linguists think of meaning as what things represent.\n",
    "    - $$\\text{signifier(symbol)}  \\leftrightarrow \\text{signified{(idea or thing)}}$$\n",
    "    - Word \"chair\" representing all the thing that are chair.\n",
    "    - Word \"running\" represents a set of actions people do, which represents the activity those actions perform i.e. 🏃‍♂️ \"\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do we have reasonable meaning in a computer?\n",
    "- Common Solution: Something like `WordNet` which is a thesaurus containing words and their relationships using  synonym set and hypernyms (\"is a\" relationship)"
