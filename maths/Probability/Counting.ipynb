    "Remember the naive definition of Probability. Finding probability reduces to a counting problem where we need to count how many elements are A and S.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Naive definition** : The naive definition of probability of an event is to count the number of ways the event could happen and divide by the total number of possible outcomes for the experiment.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "  $$P_{naive}(A) = \\frac{|A|}{|S|} = \\frac{\\text{number of outcomes favorable to A}}{\\text{total number of outcomes in S}}$$\n",

    " ### Multiplication Rule\n",
    " Imagine you are doing a compound experiment consisting of **r** random experiment such that $k^{th}$ experiment has $n_k $ possible outcomess for $k = 1, 2, 3..,r $ Then there are a total of $n_1 \\times n_2 \\times n_3 \\times ... \\times n_r $ possible outcomes for the sequence of **r** experiments.\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "Possible number of outcomes for a set with __n__ elements?: $2^n$ including the empty set $\\emptyset$ and the set itself. This follows by multiplication since for each element we can choose whether to include it or exclude it.  For instance set {1, 2, 3} has 8 subsets $\\emptyset$, {1}, {2}. {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}.\n",

In other words, here ordering matters (A person winning a car vs a person winning a juicer in lottery are different) and also, repetition is allowed. Therefore, total number of ways to choose *k* elements from set of *n* elements is:\n",

Let's do the same setting where we have a set **A** = {1, 2, 3} and ***k*** = 2, but the only difference is now replacement or in other words repetition is not allowed.

In this case, for first position we will have *n* options. For second position we will have *(n-1)* options since one applicant is already chosen for the first position. For the third position we will have *(n-2)* options, and then for $\\textit{k}^{th}$ position we will have *(n-k+1)* options. Thus when ordering matters and repetition is not allowed, the total number of ways to choose *k* elements from a set of *n* elements is:\n",

    "#### Birthday Paradox\n",
    "**Problem**:If there are *k* people in a party, what is the probability that at least two of them has the same birthday? We can assume that there are 365 days in a year, and all days are equally like to be the birthday of a specific person.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: As we have learned both **Ordered Sampling with replacement** and **Ordered Sampling without replacement** just now, let's see which one will be used here.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can probably solve this problem more easily by thinking in complementary way, instead of matching every pair of people , let's find what is the probability **P(A)**  such that no two people in the room share the birthday, our required probability will just be complement of this i.e. **1 - P(A)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in essence, we need to choose *k* samples from 365, such that they are ordered and without repetition. This will be count of how many ways such an event A can occur. Now, what will be the count of our sample space. Each person can be born on any of the 365 days. Thus each person in the party has 365 options.  This is case of ordered sampling with repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    1 - P(A) = \\frac{365 \\times 364 \\times 363 \\times ... (365 - k + 1)}{365^k}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called paradox, because people often think that probability of two people in a room sharing birthday might be low, but for just 23 people, (i.e *k* = 23) probability of such event happening is 0.5073, while for *k* = 57, It crosses 0.99. In another words, there is 99% chance that two people will share birthdays in a party of 57 people.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since ordering doesn't matter therefore $\\{1, 2\\} = \\{2, 1\\}$ and since repetition is not allowed, we don't have {1, 1} and similar pairs not in our options.\n",

It doesn't matter who sits where i.e. it doesn't matter to person A if he is on chair no. $4^{th}$ or chair $6^{th}$ (i.e. order doesn't matter) and also ofcourse same person can't occupy two chairs (i.e. repetition is not allowed). This is called a case of *n choose k* and represented as $n \\choose k $. Now contrast this with case where we wanted to choose *k* applicants from a pool of *n*. There order mattered (You can't give a job of accountant to programmer). In fact, for any *k* elements subset, of a set of n elements, we can order elements in k! ways. thus we can say\n",
